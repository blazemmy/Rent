                        <h4 id="intro">Introduction</h4>
                        <p>RentLuxy LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, “RentLuxy”, “we”, or “us”), provide an
                            online car sharing platform that
                            connects vehicle owners with travelers and locals seeking to book those vehicles.
                            RentLuxy is accessible online
                            including at <a href="index.html">rentluxy.com</a> and as an application for mobile
                            devices. The RentLuxy websites, blog, mobile applications,
                            and associated services are collectively referred to as “the Services”. By accessing or
                            using the Services, including by
                            communicating with us or other RentLuxy users, you agree to comply with, and be legally
                            bound by, the provisions of
                            these Terms of Service (these “Terms”), whether or not you become a registered user of
                            the Services. These Terms govern
                            your access to and use of the Services and constitute a binding legal agreement between
                            you and RentLuxy.
                            These Terms, together with the RentLuy privacy policy, cancellation policy,
                            nondiscrimination policy, applicable
                            insurance terms and certificates, roadside assistance terms, and the additional policies
                            (together, the “Policies”)
                            constitute the “Agreement” between you and RentLuxy (each a “Party” and together, “the
                            Parties”).</p>

                        <h4>Modification</h4>
                        <p>RentLuxy reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to modify the Services or to modify
                            the Agreement, including these
                            Terms, at any time. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the
                            Services. We will also update the
                            “Last Revised” date at the top of these Terms. If you continue to access or use the
                            Services after we have posted a
                            modification or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that
                            you agree to be bound by the
                            modified terms. If the modified terms are not acceptable to you, your sole recourse is
                            to stop using and accessing the
                            Services and close your RentLuxy Account within 30 days. If you choose to close your
                            RentLuxy Account, the previous
                            effective version of these Terms will apply to you, unless you use the Services during
                            the intervening 30 day period, in
                            which case the new version of these Terms will apply to you.</p>

                        <h4 id="elig">Eligibility, registration, verification</h4>
                        <h5>Eligibility,</h5>
                        <p>The Services are intended solely for guests who meet our age requirements in the location
                            where the vehicle is booked
                            and hosts who are 21 or older, except in the United Kingdom where we permit hosts age 18
                            to list eligible vehicles. Any
                            use of the Services by anyone that does not meet these age requirements is expressly
                            prohibited.</p>

                        <h5>Registration</h5>
                        <p>To access certain features of the Services, you must sign up for an account with us (a
                            “RentLuxy Account”). You can
                            create a RentLuxy Account by providing us your first and last name, email address, and
                            creating a password or connecting
                            through an account with a third-party site or service (including Apple, Facebook, and
                            Google). When you book a vehicle
                            as a traveler or guest (“guest”), you provide us with certain additional information
                            about yourself. Similarly, when you
                            list a vehicle as a vehicle owner or host (“host”), you provide us with certain
                            additional information about yourself
                            and your vehicle(s) (if applicable). You must provide accurate, current, and complete
                            information during the
                            registration, booking, and/or listing process. You must keep your RentLuxy Account up to
                            date at all times. Based on
                            information you provide, RentLuxy may impose additional requirements for you to book a
                            trip (e.g., providing a deposit,
                            adding a second form of payment, buying a certain level of protection plan, or other
                            requirements). To fight spam and
                            abuse of the Services, RentLuxy has implemented reCAPTCHA Enterprise, and your use of
                            reCAPTCHA is subject to a separate
                            Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.</p>

                        <h5>Verification</h5>
                        <p>Where permitted, RentLuxy has the right, but not the obligation, to undertake screenings,
                            checks, and engage in
                            processes designed to (1) help verify the identities or check the backgrounds of users,
                            including driving history and
                            driver’s license validity and (2) verify vehicle details. RentLuxy does not endorse any
                            vehicle, user, or a user’s

                        <h4>Fees, taxes</h4>
                        <h5 id="fees">Fees</h5>
                        <p>The fees we charge for using the Services and other cost structures will be itemized at
                            checkout for guests. You can
                            verify the amount for your trip at checkout before you submit your trip request. Hosts can
                            view earnings on the Host Hub
                            and learn more about their earnings breakdown. When you provide RentLuxy a payment method,
                            you authorize RentLuxy, or
                            third-party service providers acting on behalf of RentLuxy, to store your payment credential
                            for future use in the event
                            you owe RentLuxy any money. You authorize RentLuxy to use stored payment credentials for
                            balances, including for Trip
                            costs, host fees, and guest fees (e.g., late fees, security deposits, processing fees and
                            claims costs, and related
                            administrative fees). In some cases, our payment processors have arrangements with card
                            networks to automatically update
                            stored payment credentials whenever you receive a new card (e.g., replacing an expired card
                            or one that was reported
                            lost or stolen) and we will rely on such updates to stored payment credentials for balances.
                        </p>


                        <h5>Collection of fees</h5>
                        <p>RentLuxy and its service providers will employ all legal methods available to collect amounts
                            due, including the
                            engagement of collection agencies or legal counsel. RentLuxy, or the collection agencies we
                            retain, may also report
                            information about your RentLuxy Account to credit bureaus. As a result, late payments,
                            missed payments, or other
                            defaults on your RentLuxy Account may be reflected in your credit report. In addition to the
                            amount due, delinquent
                            accounts or chargebacks will be charged with fees and/or charges that are incidental to the
                            collection of delinquent
                            accounts or chargebacks including, but not limited to, collection fees, convenience fees,
                            and/or other third party
                            charges. If you wish to dispute the information RentLuxy reported to a credit bureau (i.e.,
                            Experian, Equifax, or
                            TransUnion), please contact <a href=""> help.rentluxy@gmail.com </a>. If you wish to dispute
                            the information a collection agency
                            reported to a credit bureau regarding your RentLuxy Account, you must contact the collection
                            agency directly.</p>

                        <p>In certain jurisdictions, RentLuxy may enable the collection and remittance of certain taxes
                            from or on behalf of guests
                            or hosts, based on existing and future tax regulations, including marketplace facilitator or
                            car sharing regulations.

                            separately stated, to both
                            guests and hosts on their respective trip related documents and invoices. Where RentLuxy is
                            facilitating the collection
                            and remittance of taxes, hosts are not permitted to collect the same taxes on the Services
                            in relation to their vehicle
                            sharing in that jurisdiction.</p>

                        <h5> Violations. </h5> <br>RentLuxy has the right, but not the obligation, to
                        investigate, pursue, and seek to prosecute, litigate, or
                        refer to law enforcement, violations of the Agreement to the fullest extent permissible by the
                        law.
                        RentLuxy reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, in accordance with applicable
                        law, to remove or
                        disable access to any content that RentLuxy, at its sole discretion, considers to be
                        objectionable for any reason, in
                        violation of these Terms, or otherwise harmful to the Services or our community. If we believe
                        you are abusing RentLuxy,
                        our users, or any other person in any way or violating the letter or spirit of any of these
                        Terms, we may, in our sole

                        full extent permitted under
                        applicable law.

                        <h5>Policy enforcement</h5>
                        <p>When an issue arises, we may consider the user’s performance history and the specific
                            circumstances in applying our
                            Policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the

                            sole and absolute discretion.</p>

                        <h5>Communications with you</h5>
                        <p>You agree that RentLuxy may contact you by electronic means (e.g., electronic mail;

                        <h5>Insurance and protection plans</h5>
                        <p>RentLuxy is not an insurance company and does not insure hosts or guests. Host and guest
                            protection plans made available
                            through the Services are in no way related. To be eligible for the benefits of a protection
                            plan, hosts and guests must
                            comply with these Terms. Protection plans are available through the Services only in the
                            United States. Please refer to
                            the specific terms for guests and specific terms for hosts sections below for additional
                            information based on the nature
                            of your use of the Services.</p>

                        <h5 id="guests">Specific terms for guests</h5>
                        <p>The following sections also apply if you book a vehicle using the Services:</p>

                        <h4>Guest commitments</h4>
                        <p>As a guest, you commit that you will be a legally licensed driver and provide proof to the
                            host or via the Services of a
                            current, valid driver’s license. You will treat the vehicle and any applicable Extras well
                            and will take all reasonable
                            measures to return the vehicle and any applicable Extras on time and in essentially the same
                            condition as received. You
                            will not allow anyone other than a person listed in the trip details as an Approved Driver
                            to drive the vehicle you
                            booked.</p>

                        <h4>Guest financial responsibility for physical damage to the vehicle </h4>
                        <p>The guest that booked the trip (“primary guest”) is financially responsible for all physical
                            damage to or theft of a
                            booked vehicle that occurs during a trip, plus any additional costs and fees resulting from
                            damage of any kind to the
                            vehicle, regardless of who is found to be at fault. This responsibility applies whether the
                            primary guest has their own
                            auto insurance or not.
                            Primary guests may be insured against damage to the booked vehicle under their own
                            automobile policies. When you book a
                            vehicle on RentLuxy, you agree that if any damage occurs to the booked vehicle during the
                            booked trip, you will work

                            with RentLuxy to make a claim for coverage under any policy of insurance that applies to the
                            loss. </br>
                            The primary guest can limit the amount they are obligated to pay out of their own pocket in
                            the event there is damage to
                            the booked vehicle during the booked trip by choosing a protection plan on the Services. The
                            limitation on the amount a
                            primary guest may have to pay out of pocket included in any protection plan only applies (1)
                            if the primary guest and
                            any Approved Driver abide by these Terms and (2) to physical damage that is not mechanical
                            or interior damage.

                        <h4>Auto liability insurance</h4>
                        <p>Most hosts offering a vehicle for sharing on the Services cannot offer liability insurance to
                            you. All protection plans
                            offered on the Services include coverage under an automobile liability insurance policy. In
                            the US, the policy is issued
                            to RentLuxy by Travelers Excess and Surplus Lines Company and does not provide a defense or
                            indemnification for any
                            claim asserted by RentLuy.</p>

                        <h4>Booking with Commercial Hosts</h4>
                        <p>Where a host can offer guests at least legally required minimum insurance through their own
                            commercial or rental policy,
                            the host may choose to decline insurance on the Services and provide its own policy directly
                            to you as the guest. We
                            refer to these hosts as “Commercial Hosts.” You can determine directly in the vehicle
                            listing whether the vehicle is
                            offered by a Commercial Host.
                            If you book with a Commercial Host, no third-party automobile liability insurance, financial
                            responsibility limitations
                            for physical damage, or roadside assistance is made available via the Services by RentLuxy
                            or any third-party insurance
                            partners, brokers, or producers. The Commercial Host will bill you directly for any
                            applicable protection plan after
                            booking, not through the Services. In these circumstances, a Commercial Host may require you
                            to sign additional
                            paperwork, provide a deposit, or pay additional fees, costs, or taxes after booking, for
                            instance when picking up the
                            vehicle. A Commercial Host may also have additional requirements that differ from RentLuxy
                            requirements (like requiring
                            a credit card deposit). By booking a vehicle where a Commercial Host is providing
                            protection, you agree that the
                            Commercial Host may impose additional terms and fees after booking.</p>

                        <h4>Use of the vehicle</h4>
                        <p>When you book a vehicle on the Services, you must use the vehicle only for your personal use
                            and not for any commercial
                            purposes (e.g. driving other passengers for a fee such as through Uber or Lyft or delivering
                            food or other packages)
                            unless you have express written permission from the RentLuxy Legal Department in advance.
                            You may not access a vehicle
                            until the trip start time and you must return the vehicle on time and to the correct
                            location. You must present the host
                            with a current, valid driver’s license. You must exercise reasonable care in your use of the
                            vehicle. You are required
                            at all times to operate the vehicle safely, and in compliance with all applicable laws,
                            including without limitation,
                            speed limits and prohibitions on impaired or distracted driving. In the event RentLuxy has
                            any concern about your use of
                            a vehicle, RentLuxy may terminate your trip in its discretion at any time and require the
                            return of the vehicle,
                            including recovering the vehicle on behalf of the host. You are required to wear seat belts
                            during the operation of the
                            vehicle and to require that all of your passengers wear seat belts. You are also required to
                            meet any laws or
                            regulations concerning child safety seats and other protections for children. You must not
                            leave the car unlocked or
                            with the keys unsecure (such as in the ignition). You must not engage in any prohibited uses
                            with any vehicle you book
                            through the Services. The prohibited uses list is not meant to be exhaustive. If you have
                            any concerns about your
                            planned use, please contact help.rentluxy@gmail.com If you misuse a vehicle, you will be
                            fully financially responsible
                            for any related claims, loss, or damage, and your protection plan may be voided. Guests also
                            acknowledge that using a
                            vehicle in a prohibited manner or otherwise breaching the Agreement may lower available
                            liability coverage to legal
                            minimum limits, or nullify coverage, and may furthermore nullify any comprehensive or
                            collision protection and/or
                            protection plan where allowed by applicable law.</p>

                        <h4>Condition of the vehicle and optional Extras</h4>
                        <p>You understand that third parties own the vehicles and Extras offered through the Services.
                            Each host is responsible for
                            complying with all legal requirements (including ensuring the vehicle is registered and
                            insured) and maintaining their
                            vehicle(s) in safe and roadworthy condition. Please complete a visual inspection before you
                            begin your use of the
                            vehicle. If you find damage in your initial inspection, you should upload photos of such
                            pre-existing damage at the
                            start of your reservation to ensure you are not held responsible for pre-existing damage. If
                            you find damage on your
                            initial inspection and fail to report it, RentLuxy, third-party administrators, or insurance
                            partners, may assume that
                            the damage occurred during your reservation period. If, after your initial inspection, you
                            believe that the vehicle is
                            not safe to drive, please do not use the vehicle; instead, please contact the RentLuxy team
                            immediately at
                            1-‪972-908-9380‬ in the US or 806 301 2062‬‬</p>

                        <h4>No responsibility for shared vehicles</h4>
                        <p>You acknowledge that RentLuxy is not responsible and shall not be liable for the safety,
                            roadworthiness, or legal status
                            (e.g., whether the vehicle is legally registered or the subject of a stolen vehicle report)
                            of any vehicles shared via
                            the Services beyond our policies that require hosts to ensure their vehicles are in safe and
                            operable condition, legally
                            registered to be driven on public roads, not subject to a missing or stolen vehicle report,
                            have a clean title (e.g.,
                            non-salvaged/non-branded/non-washed/non-written off), not subject to any applicable safety
                            recalls, and otherwise
                            satisfy our eligibility requirements.</p>

                        <h4>Incident reporting</h4>
                        <p>Where you elected for a protection plan when booking your trip via the Services, you must
                            immediately report any damage
                            to the vehicle you are using to RentLuxy at help.rentluxy@gmail.com , or 1-‪972-908-9380‬ in
                            the US. If there has been a
                            collision, you must also make a report to the police. You will need to use all reasonable
                            efforts to secure evidence
                            from any available witnesses and to provide RentLuxy or third-party claims administrators
                            with a written description of
                            the incident and any other information requested, including identity and insurance
                            information of any parties involved
                            in the incident. You are also required to cooperate in any loss investigation conducted by
                            RentLuxy, third party claims
                            administrators, or insurers. After an incident, you may not continue to use the vehicle
                            unless you have the explicit
                            permission of RentLuxy staff. Failure to timely report an incident or cooperate in an
                            investigation may reduce or
                            invalidate any protection plan received via the Services.‬‬</p>

                        <h4>Vehicle theft</h4>
                        <p>The following conduct may result in the reporting of the vehicle you have booked as stolen to
                            law enforcement, possibly
                            subjecting you and any other driver to arrest, and civil and/or criminal penalties, and the
                            voiding of your protection
                            plan:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you fail to return the vehicle you booked at the time and place agreed upon with the
                                host and/or designated in your
                                reservation</li>
                            <li>If you do not return the vehicle by the end of the reservation period and you have not
                                properly obtained an extension
                                of the reservation through the Services as set forth here</li>
                            <li>If the vehicle is returned to any place other than the return location on the

                                host. Any damage to, or loss or theft of, a vehicle occurring prior to the host
                                inspecting the vehicle upon return at
                                the end of the reservation is the guest’s responsibility</li>
                            <li>If you misrepresent facts to the host pertaining to booking, use, or operation of
                                vehicle</li>
                            <li>If the vehicle’s interior components are stolen or damaged or the vehicle itself is

                                is left unlocked or running or unattended with the keys not secured during reservation
                                period</li>
                            <li>If you fail or refuse to communicate in good faith with the host, police, RentLuxy, or
                                other authorities with a full
                                report of any accident or vandalism involving the vehicle or otherwise fail to cooperate
                                in the investigation of any
                                accident or vandalism</li>
                            <li>If the vehicle is operated by anyone who has given a fictitious name, false address, or
                                a false or invalid driver’s
                                license, whose driver’s license becomes invalid during the reservation period, who has
                                obtained the keys without
                                permission of the host, or who misrepresents or withholds facts to/from the host or
                                RentLuxy material to the booking,
                                use, or operation of vehicle</li>
                        </ul>

                        The primary guest who books the reservation is responsible for any private investigation costs
                        RentLuxy deems necessary
                        to recover a vehicle that is not returned. In addition, a $500 case administration fee will be
                        imposed on the primary
                        guest if RentLuxy and/or the host has to report a vehicle as stolen to law enforcement due to it
                        not being returned.

                        </p>

                        <h5>Repossession</h5>
                        <p>RentLuxy, a hired agent of RentLuxy, or the host may repossess any vehicle booked through the
                            Services without demand,

                            found illegally parked,
                            apparently abandoned, or used in violation of applicable law or these Terms.</p>

                        <h5>Missing Vehicles</h5>
                        <p>If a vehicle you have booked through the Services goes missing and/or is stolen during the
                            reservation period (or
                            extension period), you must immediately return the original ignition key to the host, file a
                            police report immediately
                            after discovering the vehicle is missing or stolen, but in no event more than 12 hours after

                        <h4>Specific terms for hosts</h4>

                        <p>The following sections also apply if you share your vehicle through the Services:</p>

                        <h5 id="hosts">Host commitments</h5>
                        <p>As a host, you commit that you will provide a safe and legally registered and insured
                            vehicle, with current license
                            plates, with a clean (non-salvage/branded/written off) title, and in good mechanical
                            condition. You will provide such
                            vehicle on time but only to a guest who is listed on the Services as an Approved Driver for
                            the trip. You commit that
                            your listings will be complete and accurate and you will honor all representations made in
                            your listings, including
                            honoring the price quoted to a guest. You will not cancel a booking for the purpose of
                            seeking a higher price from a
                            guest. You will not offer any vehicle or optional Extra that you do not yourself own or have
                            authority to share or that
                            may not be shared for compensation pursuant to the terms and conditions of any agreement
                            with a third party, including,
                            but not limited to, a lease or financing agreement. If your vehicle is subject to a lease,
                            loan, or other financing
                            agreement, you must confirm sharing your vehicle on RentLuxy does not violate the terms of
                            the contract with the
                            lienholder. You will not offer any Extra that is not safe, clean, and acceptable for the use
                            it is intended. You will
                            not offer any vehicle that is the subject of a missing or stolen vehicle report. You will
                            not offer any vehicle that is
                            the subject of a safety recall without first properly addressing the matter subject to the
                            recall. You will not offer a
                            vehicle that is not roadworthy (i.e., not “street legal”) in the location where it is shared
                            and it will not have any
                            illegal modifications to any part of the vehicle. You will remove any firearms or other
                            weapons from your vehicle prior
                            to providing it to a guest. You will repay loans related to your RentLuxy business on time
                            and in full.</p>

                        <h5>Information given at registration</h5>
                        <p>When you sign up for RentLuxy, you will identify passenger vehicle(s) that you want to list
                            for sharing through the
                            Services. Each vehicle must meet the requirements for RentLuxy. You may only use the
                            Services in connection with
                            vehicles that you own or otherwise have all the necessary rights and permissions to share
                            for compensation.</p>

                        <h5>Listing only on the Services</h5>
                        <p>In the United States, any vehicle you list on the Services must be exclusively listed on the
                            Services. You cannot list
                            any vehicles you intend to share on the Services on any other car sharing marketplace.
                            Failure to abide by this
                            condition may result in fines, penalties, denial of physical damage claims, removal of the
                            vehicle from the Services,
                            account closure, or other action, in RentLuxy’s sole discretion. This does not limit
                            Commercial Hosts’ (as defined

                        <h5>RentLuxy photography</h5>
                        <p>RentLuxy may offer hosts the option of having photographers take photographs of their
                            vehicles and/or hosts with their
                            vehicles (“Images”). You alone are responsible for using the Images in connection with your
                            RentLuxy listing and you
                            agree that you will cease using the Images if they no longer accurately represent your
                            vehicle. You agree that RentLuxy
                            is the sole and exclusive owner - or exclusive licensee, as allowed by applicable law - of
                            all right, title, and
                            interest in all copyrights, trademark rights, and any and all other intellectual property

                            and you shall take no action
                            to challenge or object to the validity of such rights or RentLuxy’s ownership or
                            registration thereof. You acknowledge
                            that RentLuxy may use the Images for advertising, marketing, commercial, and other business
                            purposes in any media or
                            platform, whether in relation to your listing or otherwise, without further notice or
                            compensation. Further, you waive
                            any and all rights to royalties or moral rights you may have in the Images. If you use the
                            RentLuxy photography program,
                            you agree that you will not use the Images in connection with sharing your vehicle on any
                            platform, website, or
                            application other than RentLuxy. At RentLuxy’s request, you will execute documents and take
                            such further acts as
                            RentLuxy may reasonably request to assist RentLuxy to acquire, perfect, and maintain its
                            intellectual property rights
                            and other legal protection in the Images.</p>

                        <h5>Vehicle availability</h5>
                        <p>Once a trip is booked, you must make the vehicle available or deliver the vehicle as expected
                            by the guest. If you offer
                            the guest the option to pick up your vehicle at a persistent specified location, you must
                            supply the location of the
                            vehicle accurately to RentLuxy and ensure that the vehicle is available at that location at
                            the beginning of the
                            reservation period. In order to qualify for available protection plans, you must verify that
                            a prospective guest has a
                            current, valid driver’s license before you provide the guest your vehicle, and ensure the
                            driver’s license matches the
                            name on the reservation and that the person picking up the vehicle appears to match the
                            photograph on a facially valid
                            driver’s license.</p>

                        <h4>Pricing, earnings, and payments</h4>
                        <p>You will have the ability to set and revise the vehicle’s pricing as you choose. RentLuxy
                            will pay you the amount
                            collected from guests that book your vehicle, less the applicable fees payable to RentLuxy.
                            To the extent you owe
                            RentLuxy or any third party lender (including via Kiva Microfunds or LoanGlide) money for
                            any reason, RentLuxy also
                            reserves the right to deduct those amounts from your earnings payment, debit your bank
                            account, charge any of your
                            payment methods on file, and/or send you an invoice.</p>

                        <h5>Payment Processing</h5>
                        <p>In some countries, payment processing services are provided by Stripe and subject to the
                            Stripe Connected Account
                            Agreement, which includes the Stripe Services Agreement (collectively, the "Stripe Terms").
                            In countries where you
                            receive payment proceeds via Stripe, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Terms, which may be
                            modified from time to time.
                            As a condition of RentLuxy enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you
                            authorize RentLuxy to obtain all
                            necessary access and perform all necessary activity on your Stripe Connected Account to
                            facilitate sharing of your
                            vehicle. You further agree to provide accurate and complete information about you, and
                            authorize RentLuxy to share it
                            and transaction information with Stripe for the purposes of facilitating the payment
                            processing services provided by
                            Stripe. RentLuxy reserves the right to switch payment processing vendors at its discretion.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Airport delivery; personal vehicle sharing regulations</h4>
                        <p>Some airports where you offer delivery may take the position that you must have a permit to
                            use airport premises and
                            remit fees. While RentLuxy does not believe that rental car permits should apply to
                            peer-to-peer car sharing, not all
                            airport authorities agree with this position. There is personal vehicle sharing legislation
                            that may apply to you.</p>

                        <h4>Maintenance</h4>
                        <p>You are required to regularly check your vehicle for any defects in its operations or safety.
                            You promise that, at all
                            times, your vehicle will be in safe and roadworthy condition, in good mechanical condition,
                            and in full compliance with
                            all applicable inspection and registration requirements. You will only list vehicles with a
                            clean, non-salvaged,
                            non-written off, non-washed, and non-branded title. You agree to respond to any applicable
                            recall or similar safety
                            notices and to complete any recommended action before allowing your vehicle to be booked. In
                            addition, if RentLuxy
                            believes that your vehicle does not conform to reasonable standards, RentLuxy may notify you
                            and reserves the right to
                            remove or decline listing your vehicle until its concerns have been resolved. RentLuxy may,
                            but does not commit to,
                            undertake efforts to ensure the safety of vehicles booked through the Services.</p>

                        <h4>Reporting vehicle damage</h4>
                        <p>If you did not decline a protection plan made available via the Services, and you believe
                            that a guest has caused any
                            damage to your vehicle, you are required to report that damage as soon as you become aware
                            of it (and in any event, no
                            more than 24 hours after the scheduled end of the trip) and to provide reasonable
                            cooperation in the investigation of
                            the damage so that it can be eligible for coverage. Based on the investigation, RentLuxy or
                            third-party claims
                            administrators will reasonably determine whether the damage occurred during the reservation
                            period and is eligible for
                            coverage. If it was, and you did not decline a protection plan made available via the
                            Services, you will be reimbursed
                            for the loss as described in the sections below. If RentLuxy is not given prompt notice as
                            described in this paragraph,
                            or if you do not provide reasonable cooperation in the investigation by RentLuxy or
                            third-party claims administrators,
                            we may not be able to determine the cause. In that case, you agree that we may decline any
                            reimbursement or coverage for
                            such damage.</p>

                        <h4>Physical damage to your vehicle</h4>
                        <h5>Physical damage reimbursement (US).</h5>
                        <p>The protection plans available to hosts in the US also address the allocation of financial
                            consequences of physical
                            damage to the vehicle offered by a host during a trip. Physical damage contractual
                            reimbursement from RentLuxy applies
                            to your vehicle in the event of a collision and to comprehensive events during the trip, and
                            is subject to terms and
                            exclusions.</p>

                        <h5>Actual cash value</h5>
                        <p>If RentLuxy, or third-party claims administrators, choose to pay you the actual cash value
                            for your vehicle, you will
                            be required to do one of the following at the sole discretion of RentLuxy as a condition for
                            receiving payment: (1)
                            transfer title to the vehicle, and, if requested, physically deliver the vehicle to RentLuxy
                            or a third party appointed
                            by RentLuxy to accept title and physical delivery (if applicable); or (2) retain title to
                            the vehicle and accept a
                            reduction of the actual cash value equal to the salvage value of the damaged vehicle based
                            on the highest third-party
                            salvage quote that RentLuxy obtains for the vehicle. The standard for determining the actual
                            cash value will be as
                            determined by RentLuxy or its third-party claims administrators and in compliance with
                            applicable law.</p>

                        <h5>Exclusions to physical damage reimbursement and coverage. Protection plans selected by hosts
                            on the Services do not

                        <ul>
                            <li>Optional extras or personal property, including aftermarket installations (e.g.,

                                your vehicle or damaged during a trip. Remove all personal property before making your

                                vehicle when listing it on the Services (for example, falsely represent the make, model,
                                or year of the vehicle), any
                                protection plan you selected will be voided. A protection will be voided under this
                                provision even if the underlying
                                circumstances are not directly related to the damage or harm at issue. You acknowledge

                                material and that they serve to ensure your compliance. In the event your protection
                                plan is voided, the remainder of
                                the Agreement, these Terms, and Policies remain in effect.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Other host-specific insurance matters</h5>
                        <p>You will maintain valid and up to date registration information and proof of insurance in any
                            vehicle you share on the
                            Services. You must maintain your own auto insurance policy for any vehicle you list on the
                            Services and such policy must
                            meet any minimum insurance levels required by law. You may need additional insurance
                            coverage, including physical damage
                            coverage, if you share a vehicle subject to a lease or loan. You agree to provide RentLuxy
                            with information regarding
                            your auto insurance policy as may be requested and to keep such information up to date.
                            Where not prohibited by law, you
                            hereby appoint RentLuxy or a wholly owned subsidiary of RentLuxy as your attorney-in-fact
                            for the purpose of filing
                            insurance claims, receiving insurance payment, otherwise administering an applicable
                            insurance policy, and/or working

                        <h4>Missing vehicles</h4>
                        <p>If you selected a protection plan via the Services and your vehicle goes missing, is not
                            returned, and/or is stolen
                            during the reservation period (or extension period), you, as the host, must immediately
                            contact a RentLuxy
                            representative and follow his or her instructions, including cooperating with RentLuxy, the
                            police, and any other
                            authorities in all related to the investigation of the theft. If you are instructed by
                            RentLuxy to file a police report,
                            you must do so within 24 hours of receiving those instructions.</p>

                        <h4>Indemnification of host</h4>
                        <p>If you selected a protection plan via the Services, in the event of any claim for a loss or
                            injury that occurs during
                            the use of your vehicle by a guest (or by RentLuxy itself), subject to your compliance with
                            these Terms and the
                            Policies, RentLuxy or its insurers will defend and indemnify you, subject to any exclusions
                            or limitations in the policy
                            or policies of insurance contained with the protection plan, against such claims as required
                            by applicable law. In
                            connection with any indemnified claim, you are required to give RentLuxy or its insurers
                            prompt written notice of the
                            claim, allow RentLuxy sole control over the defense of the claim, and provide RentLuxy
                            reasonable cooperation in its
                            defense of the claim, at RentLuxy’s expense. If RentLuxy or its insurers reimburses you for
                            a lost or damaged vehicle
                            and you later receive payment for some or all of your vehicle from a third party (e.g. a
                            third party insurance company
                            or restitution), you must reimburse RentLuxy any monies received from that third party in an
                            amount equivalent to, but
                            not to exceed, the funds provided to you by RentLuxy.</p>

                        <h4>Additional terms for Commercial Hosts</h4>
                        <p>If you decline a protection plan made available via the Services (such as if you choose to
                            offer your own
                            commercial/rental policy to guests) or where no protection plan is offered via the Services
                            you are a "Commercial Host."
                            In exchange for keeping more of the trip price for yourself, when you decline a RentLuxy
                            protection package or where no
                            protection package is offered, you waive, on behalf of yourself and any affiliated
                            individuals (including, but not
                            limited to, employees, employers, associates, contractors, or any other related personnel)
                            or entities (whether they be
                            corporations, partnerships, sole proprietorships, limited liability companies, or otherwise)
                            (collectively,
                            “Affiliates”) any protection plan normally offered via the Services, to you or any
                            Affiliates, your vehicles, and any
                            guests or approved drivers of all of the vehicles you list on RentLuxy.
                            When you choose to provide your own commercial rental insurance in the United States, or
                            where no protection or
                            insurance is offered via the Services in your region, you, as the host, or an authorized
                            representative acting on behalf
                            of the host, shall be exclusively responsible for providing commercial rental insurance
                            coverage for any reservation of
                            your vehicles through RentLuxy. You shall carry no less than the minimum applicable
                            liability and/or physical damage
                            automobile insurance for your vehicle, your guest, and his/her authorized drivers. When you
                            select to decline a
                            protection plan or where none is offered in your region, you represent and warrant that (1)
                            you are a licensed
                            commercial rental car company or are authorized to act on behalf of and bind a commercial
                            rental car company in
                            connection with listing vehicles on RentLuxy, or (2) you are an individual or company, or
                            are authorized to act on
                            behalf of, and bind a company, that can offer commercial rental car insurance to guests.
                            You further acknowledge and agree that you shall receive no protection or coverage from
                            RentLuxy or any affiliates,
                            whether that be financial responsibility for physical damage, third-party liability
                            protection, uninsured or
                            underinsured motorist coverage, PIP or any similar coverage or indemnification, roadside
                            assistance, or trust and safety
                            support as part of a booking of your vehicle when you have chosen to provide your own
                            commercial rental insurance. You
                            shall add RentLuxy as an additional insured on all applicable automobile and excess
                            liability policies. These provisions
                            replace and supersede any representation made by RentLuxy, or those acting on behalf of
                            RentLuxy, including but not
                            limited to statements made on the Services, these Terms, Help Center, Policies, emails,
                            and/or marketing materials,
                            concerning protection plans, insurance, and roadside assistance otherwise offered to host
                            and guests when the hosts do
                            not decline protection via the Services.
                            RentLuxy reserves the right to, but does not commit to, satisfy itself that you are, or are
                            acting on behalf of, a
                            licensed commercial rental car company and have the ability to offer commercial auto rental
                            insurance to renters/drivers
                            of your vehicles when you choose to decline protection. If RentLuxy has any concerns in this
                            regard, you agree that
                            RentLuxy can automatically, and in its sole discretion, default all of your vehicles to a
                            protection plan of our choice,
                            along with its associated fees (if offered in your region), remove your listings, or suspend
                            your RentLuxy Account.
                            If you lose the ability to offer commercial rental insurance to your guests (for example,
                            your policy has been canceled
                            or nonrenewed), you must immediately change the status of your vehicle. If the change is
                            temporary, you can snooze your
                            vehicle(s). If you need to permanently change the protection plan for your vehicle(s) back
                            to a protection plan made
                            available via the Services, contact us at help.rentluxy@gmail.com or message us on
                            1-972-908-9380‬. Never let a guest
                            pick up a vehicle or continue to use a vehicle without providing them insurance coverage.
                            You must disclose on your listing page any applicable additional fees, costs, and/or taxes
                            you assess in addition to
                            other requirements you may impose (such as a security deposit or if you do not accept debit
                            cards, for example). You
                            must never surprise guests with hidden costs or requirements at pick-up. RentLuxy reserves
                            the right, in its sole
                            discretion, to default your vehicles to a protection plan of our choice, remove your
                            listings, or suspend your RentLuxy
                            Account for failure to be transparent with guests about fees, costs, and requirements in
                            your vehicle listing page.
                            You acknowledge that the actual damages likely to result from your breach of this
                            section are difficult to estimate
                            accurately and would be difficult for RentLuxy to prove with certainty. You will pay
                            RentLuxy a fee for liquidated
                            damages to compensate RentLuxy for any such conduct. This amount is not intended as a
                            punishment for any such breach,
                            but rather as a reasonable estimate where actual damages are difficult to estimate
                            accurately and/or prove with
                            certainty.
                            You shall defend, indemnify, and hold RentLuxy, its subsidiaries, affiliates, employees,
                            officers, directors, and
                            agents, and any of your guests or their authorized drivers, harmless from and against any
                            and all claims, demands,
                            suits, judgments, costs, expenses, liabilities, attorneys fees, damages, consequential

                            arising out of any reservation
                            or use of any vehicles, including without limitation, any vehicle damage, personal injury or
                            property damage where you
                            have declined a protection plan made available via the Services or one is not available in

                        <h5>Pre-arbitration dispute resolution</h5>
                        <p>Should a dispute or claim arise between us, you and RentLuxy agree to notify the other Party
                            of the nature of the
                            dispute or claim prior to initiating arbitration, and the Parties will attempt to negotiate
                            an informal resolution to it
                            first. We will contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact us
                            by email at
                            help.rentluxy@gmail.com Please provide your name, phone number, email, mailing address, and
                            briefly describe both the
                            nature of your dispute and the relief you would like from RentLuxy. If the Parties are
                            unable to resolve the claims
                            described in the notice within 30 days after the notice is sent, then the Party intending to
                            pursue arbitration agrees
                            to notify the other Party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to
                            initiate arbitration, a claim must
                            be filed with either FairClaims or the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) as set forth
                            below, pursuant to the
                            FairClaims Rules or AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as appropriate. A form for initiating
                            arbitration proceedings is
                            available on the FairClaims website or AAA's website. (AAA provides a Demand for Arbitration
                            form.) Any settlement offer
                            made by you or RentLuxy shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>

                        <h5>Applicable law</h5>
                        <p>The below Agreement to Arbitrate evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and is
                            therefore governed by the
                            Federal Arbitration Act and the applicable procedural rules of FairClaims or AAA, as
                            applicable (see "Arbitration
                            procedures" below). To the extent state law is applicable to the Agreement to Arbitrate, the
                            Parties agree that the
                            substantive law of the state of Arizona will apply, without regard to its conflict of law
                            provisions.</p>

                        <h5>Agreement to Arbitrate</h5>
                        <p>The Parties each agree that any and all disputes, claims, or controversies that have arisen
                            or may arise at any time
                            between you and RentLuxy (including its respective subsidiaries, employees, officers,
                            directors, agents, third-party
                            insurance brokers or products, and third-party claims administrators) will be resolved by
                            binding arbitration according
                            to the procedure set forth below. For the purpose of this Agreement to Arbitrate,
                            “disputes," "claims,” and
                            "controversies" shall have the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced and includes,
                            any and all disputes and/or
                            claims that arise out of or in any way relate to your relationship with RentLuxy, including
                            but not limited to: (1) your
                            use of the Services, (2) the Agreement, these Terms and/or this Agreement to Arbitrate,
                            including the interpretation,
                            validity, enforceability, or scope of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or (3) your use of, or
                            access to the Services, and
                            anything sold, offered, or purchased through the Services (such as booking, listing, or
                            sharing a vehicle). Through this
                            Agreement to Arbitrate, and subject to the below exceptions, the Parties intend to arbitrate
                            all disputes or claims
                            regardless of whether they are based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort
                            (including, but not limited to,
                            fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or
                            equitable theory and regardless
                            of whether they arose or accrued before the Parties entered into this Agreement to
                            Arbitrate. For avoidance of doubt,
                            the Parties expressly agree that this Agreement to Arbitrate encompasses all disputes or
                            claims pertaining to the
                            validity, enforceability, or scope of this Agreement to Arbitrate and any such disputes or
                            claims will be referred to
                            binding arbitration and will be resolved by the arbitrator and not a court.</p>

                        <h5>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate The only exceptions to this Agreement to Arbitrate are
                            as follows:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Disputes or claims that can be brought in small claims court</li>
                            <li>Injunctive or equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,

                                rights. However, the Parties
                                agree that any court proceedings shall be stayed pending the final resolution in
                                arbitration of any arbitrable claims or
                                issues</li>
                            <li>Any cause of action or claim for relief which cannot be arbitrated as a matter of
                                applicable statute or public policy.
                                However, the Parties agree that any such court proceedings shall be stayed pending the
                                final resolution in arbitration
                                of any arbitrable claims or issues</li>
                            <li>In the event California law is found to apply to this Agreement to Arbitrate, any remedy

                                proceedings shall be stayed pending the

                        <h5>Arbitration procedures</h5>
                        <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator
                            instead of a judge or jury,
                            and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. An arbitrator can award the same
                            damages and relief on an
                            individual basis that a court can award to an individual.
                            The arbitration will be conducted by FairClaims in accordance with its Arbitration Rules and
                            Procedures effective at the
                            time a claim is made. Where the relief sought is $25,000 or less (not including attorneys'
                            fees and expenses), those
                            Arbitration Rules and Procedures may limit the proceeding to a written submission and, if
                            requested or at the
                            arbitrator’s discretion, there may be a live hearing by teleconference or videoconference.
                            Where the relief sought is
                            $25,001 or more (not including attorneys’ fees and expenses), those Arbitration Rules and
                            Procedures may provide for
                            limited discovery and streamlined proceedings. In the event FairClaims declines to or is
                            unable to adjudicate the claim,
                            the arbitration will be conducted by the AAA under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, as
                            modified by this Agreement to
                            Arbitrate.</p>
                        <p>In all cases in which a live hearing is requested or required, you and/or RentLuxy may attend
                            by video or phone. To the
                            extent a location must be established for the arbitration, it shall be held in the county in
                            which you reside or at
                            another mutually agreed location.</p>
                        <p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law,
                            including recognized
                            principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The
                            arbitrator shall not be bound by
                            rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but is bound by rulings in prior
                            arbitrations involving the same
                            RentLuxy user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be
                            final and binding and judgment
                            on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
                            thereof.</p>
                        <p>Where permitted, the Parties agree that all communications, evidence, and rulings in the
                            arbitration will remain
                            confidential, except as reasonably necessary to enforce or implement such rulings or this
                            Agreement to Arbitrate.</p> </br>
                        <h5>Costs of arbitration</h5>
                        <p>If you initiate arbitration proceedings, you will be responsible for certain costs. Where the
                            relief sought is $25,000
                            or less (not including attorneys’ fees and expenses), you will be responsible for the
                            initial filing fee, capped at
                            $375, and RentLuxy will cover any additional fees or costs. Where the relief sought is
                            $25,001 or more (not including
                            attorneys’ fees and expenses), you and RentLuxy will each pay your own arbitration fees
                            consistent with the rules set by
                            FairClaims (or AAA, as applicable) at the time the claim was made, unless otherwise stated
                            in these Terms.</p>
                        <h5>Severability</h5>
                        <p>With the exception of the provisions in the below section “Prohibition of class and
                            representative actions and
                            non-individualized relief,” if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of the Agreement
                            to Arbitrate is invalid or
                            unenforceable, the other parts of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If an
                            arbitrator or court decides that
                            any of the provisions in the section “Prohibition of class and representative actions and
                            non-individualized relief” is
                            invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of the Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and
                            void. The remainder of the
                            Agreement, these Terms, and dispute resolution section will continue to apply.</p>

                            respects if you reside anywhere other than the United States. You and RentLuxy both agree to
                            submit to the non-exclusive
                            jurisdiction of the English courts. If you are able to bring a claim arising out of or in
                            connection with the Agreement
                            against RentLuxy in court, a court located in England is acceptable, but you may also elect
                            to bring a claim in the
                            court of another country instead. English law will apply in all cases.</p>

                            law. Termination of access to
                            the Services will not release a Party from any obligations it incurred prior to the
                            termination and RentLuxy may retain
                            and continue to use any information, including but not limited to photography, previously

                            of the Agreement will not have any effect on the disclaimers, waiver or liability
                            limitations, or legal disputes
                            provisions under the Agreement and/or any fees due, and all of those terms will survive any
                            termination of the
                            Agreement.</p>

                        <h4>Indemnification</h4>
                        <p>You agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold RentLuxy and its subsidiaries, officers,
                            directors, employees, and
                            agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses,
                            including, without limitation,
                            reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with: (1) your
                            access to or use of the
                            Services, (2) your violation of these Terms, (3) your user content, (4) your interaction
                            with any other user of the
                            Services, or (5) your booking of a vehicle or creation of a listing for a vehicle. Such
                            indemnification includes but is
                            not limited to any injuries, losses, or damages (compensatory, direct, incidental,
                            consequential, or otherwise) arising
                            in connection with or as a result of a booking, sharing, or use of a vehicle or optional
                            Extra. This indemnification
                            provision is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between RentLuxy and you. It
                            shall apply to the extent
                            permitted by applicable law, and any aspects of it that are deemed unenforceable shall be
                            severed while leaving the
                            remainder in effect.</p>

                        <h4>Liquidated damages</h4>
                        <p>You acknowledge that the actual damages likely to result from your breaches of the Agreement
                            by any of the following are
                            difficult to estimate accurately and would be difficult for RentLuxy to prove with
                            certainty: (1) engaging in gray
                            market transactions, as defined in these Terms, (2) using the RentLuxy domains, trademarks,
                            or taglines without
                            RentLuxy's express consent, including without limitation registering website domains or
                            social media handles, or bidding
                            on online advertising key words, (3) suing or asserting legal claims against the RentLuxy
                            Parties or a RentLuxy user in
                            any manner prohibited or waived herein, (4) as a host, sharing your vehicle via the Services
                            with expired registration
                            stickers or without current registration paperwork in the vehicle, (5) as a host, offering
                            any vehicle that is the
                            subject of a missing or stolen vehicle report, (6) as a host, offering any vehicle or
                            releasing a vehicle to a guest
                            that is not roadworthy or is otherwise in an unsafe condition, (7) as a host, cancel or
                            modify a trip to manipulate the
                            price or potential earnings for a vehicle, or (8) creating or using a RentLuxy account that
                            has the effect of
                            circumventing RentLuxy’s suspension, termination, or closure of another RentLuxy account.
                            You will pay RentLuxy $5,500
                            per breach in Liquidated Damages to compensate RentLuxy for any such conduct. This amount is
                            not intended as a
                            punishment for any such breach, but rather as a reasonable estimate where actual damages are
                            difficult estimate
                            accurately and/or prove with certainty. This liquidated damages provision is a fundamental
                            element of the basis of the
                            bargain between RentLuxy and you. It shall apply to the extent permitted by applicable law,
                            and any aspects of it that
                            are deemed unenforceable shall be severed while leaving the remainder in effect.</p>
