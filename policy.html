                                reasonably necessary to
                                facilitate the transaction. For example, RentLuxy may provide your mobile phone number
                                to facilitate communication, your
                                driver's license information to confirm license validity, or your photograph to
                                facilitate identification. We will also
                                share the address of the vehicle and, if applicable, the proposed delivery location with
                                the other party. If you used
                                the Trip Photo feature, we may share the trip photos you upload and associated captions
                                with the other party. The other
                                party may also send you text messages (such as to confirm pickup or delivery location).
                                Standard telephone minutes and
                                text and data charges may apply.</p>

                                connection with a business transaction (or potential business transaction) such as a
                                corporate divestiture, merger,
                                consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of
                                bankruptcy or dissolution.</p>

                            <h4>Responding to legal requests, preventing harm, and protecting our rights</h4>
                            <p>We may disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement, governmental or tax

                                follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by
                                default until you change your
                                settings. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have

                                installing browser plugins like Privacy Badger, Ghostery, or uBlock Origin, and
                                configuring them to block third party

                            <h5>Choosing not to share your personal information</h5>
                            <p>Where we are required by law to collect your personal information, or where we need your
                                personal information in order
                                to provide the Services to you, if you do not provide this information when requested
                                (or we later delete it at your
                                request), we may not be able to provide you with the Services.</p>

                            <h5>Third-party platforms and social media networks</h5>
                            <p>If you choose to connect the Services to a third-party platform or social media network,
                                such as by using the third
                                party’s authentication service to log into your account on the Services, you may be able
                                to control your settings
                                through the third-party platform or social media network. If you withdraw our ability to
                                access certain information from
                                a third-party platform or social media network, that choice will not apply to
                                information that we have already received
                                from that third party.</p>

                            <h5>Refunds, Cancellations, and Travel Issues</h5>
                            <p>In general, if as a Guest you cancel a Reservation, the amount refunded to
                                you is determined by the check-in time to that Reservation. But, in certain situations,
                                other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If
                                something outside your control forces you to cancel a
                                Reservation, you may be eligible for a partial or full refund. If the Host cancels, or
                                you experience a Travel Issue, you may be eligible for rebooking assistance or a partial
                                or full refund.
                                Different policies apply to certain categories of Listings, and you will be provided
                                with the details about what is covered,
                                and what refund applies in each
                                situation.</p>

                            <h5>Security</h5>
                            <p>We employ a number of technical, physical, and organizational measures designed to
                                protect information against
                                unauthorized access, destruction, or alteration while it is under our control. However,
                                no method of transmitting or
                                storing information can be 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your
                                personal information.</p>

                                providers. These locations may be
                                outside of your state, province, or country of residence, and may have different and/or
                                less protective data protection
                                rules than those of your state, province, or country. As a result, this information may

                                on or through the Services or
                                otherwise to us unless specifically requested.</p>

                                wording discrepancies between such version and the English version, the English wording
                                takes precedence.</p>

                            <h4>Information for California residents</h4>
                            <h5>Scope.</h5>
                            <p>This section applies only to California residents entitled to receive the information in
                                this section under the
                                California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"). It describes how we collect, use, and
                                share Personal Information of
                                California residents when we act as a "business" as defined under the CCPA, and their
                                rights with respect to their
                                Personal Information. For purposes of this section, "Personal Information" has the
                                meaning given in the CCPA but does
                                not include information excluded from the scope of the CCPA. In some cases, we may
                                provide a different privacy notice to
                                certain categories of California residents, such as job applicants, in which case that
                                notice will apply instead of this
                                section.</p>

                            <h4>Your California privacy rights</h4>
                            <p>As a California resident, you have the rights listed below.</p>

                            <h4>Information.</h4>
                            <p>You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your

                                <li>The categories of Personal Information that we have collected</li>
                                <li>The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information</li>

                                    so, the categories of Personal
                                    Information received by each category of third-party recipient</li>
                                <li>Whether we have sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of
                                    Personal Information received by each
                                    category of third-party recipient</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Access</h4>

                            <h4>Nondiscrimination</h4>
                            <p>You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination in the
                                form of any unlawful denial of
                                service, increase in the price of services, decrease in service quality, or suggestion
                                that you may be penalized for
                                exercising your rights.</p>

                            <h4>We do not sell your Personal Information</h4>
                            <p>Based on our understanding of the term "sell" under the CCPA, we do not sell personal
                                information to third parties and
                                have not sold Personal Information during the twelve months preceding the "last revised"
                                date of this Privacy Policy.
                                However, like many companies online, we use services provided by Google, Facebook, and
                                others that help deliver
                                interest-based ads to you as described in the section above entitled Interest-based
                                advertising. We describe how you can
                                opt-out of use of your Personal Information for interest-based advertising in the
                                section entitled Interest-based
                                advertising choices.</p>

                            <h4>How to exercise your rights</h4>

                                requirements; to establish or

                                personal information and isolate it
                                from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                                additional safeguards to personal information under European data protection laws, we
                                will do so, for example, by
                                implementing the standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission.

                                things, and to treat each other and their property with respect, dignity, and
                                compassion. Our shared commitment to these
                                values enables every member of our community to feel welcome on our platform regardless

                                born. We have a zero-tolerance
